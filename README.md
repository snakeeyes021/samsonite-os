# SamsoniteOS

### Purpose
The purpose of SamsoniteOS is to round out the offerings of Bazzite, both with some of the features included in Bluefin DX (and therefore Bazzite DX) as well as a few features, apps, and configs not present in either. Its primary raison d'être is to provide driver support for Pascal-series Nvidia cards on a Bluefin/Bazzite DX-style OS. While vanilla Bazzite will support Pascal cards through 2028ish, both Bluefin, vanilla or DX, and Bazzite DX, have dropped support; therefore the only way to achieve said developer experience with Pascal cards is to configure it oneself on top of vanilla Bazzite. Enter SamsoniteOS.

### Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> **GNOME ONLY:** This image is based on GNOME. **Do not rebase** from a KDE-based image (like Kinoite or Bazzite-KDE), as this can cause significant desktop environment conflicts. If you are currently on KDE, please install fresh using an ISO.

**Rebasing from Silverblue, Bluefin, or Bazzite (GNOME):**

To switch to SamsoniteOS from an existing GNOME-based Fedora Atomic installation:

1.  **Rebase to the signed image:**
    ```bash
    rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/snakeeyes021/samsonite-os:latest
    ```

2.  **Reboot:**
    ```bash
    systemctl reboot
    ```
