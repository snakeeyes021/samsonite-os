# RedFoxOS Detailed To-Do

## 🚨 Infrastructure Fixes
- [x] **Migrate to DNF Module**
    - [x] Update `recipes/_common-modules.yml` to replace `rpm-ostree` module with `dnf`.
    - [x] Delete `containerfiles/dnf-overrides/Containerfile` once verified.
- [x] **Update README.md**
    - [x] Update "Rebasing" section: Explicitly warn about the Silverblue blocker (Signed Image vs. Unsigned Silverblue Policy).
- [ ] **Curate & Fix Flatpaks**
    - [x] **Fix "Nag on Boot":** Investigate and disable the repetitive Flatpak installation check on every boot.
    - [x] **Restore Missing Apps:**
        - [x] **Research:** Audit a fresh Silverblue rebase to identify *all* missing base apps (beyond just Firefox/Extension Manager).
        - [x] Ensure identified apps are in the default list.
    - [x] **Curate Defaults:** Review `recipes/_common-modules.yml` and remove unwanted placeholders.
        - [ ] **Research:** Can we inject the "Discrete GPU" preference file without forcing the app install? (if so, that should be a default; if not we may need to install Heroic by default)


## ⚙️ System Defaults (GSchema Overrides)
*These settings apply to everyone by default (via `gschema-overrides`).*

- [x] **Keyboard Shortcuts Strategy**
    - [x] Determine which shortcuts should be controlled by GNOME and which by Tiling Shell (the below might not all be correct)
        - [x] Navigation: `Ctrl`+`Super`+`Arrow` (Workspaces).
        - [x] Window Move: `Shift`+`Super`+`Arrow`.
        - [x] Tiling Snap: `Super`+`Arrow`.
        - [x] Close Window: `Super`+`q`.
- [ ] **Dash to Dock (Disabled by default, but configured)**
    - [ ] **Behavior:** Isolate Workspaces (`true`).
    - [ ] **Click Action:** `minimize-or-previews` (Focus, minimize, or show previews).
    - [ ] **Size:** Fixed icon size (Scroll to reveal).
    - [ ] **Size:** Icon size limit (40px).
    - [ ] **Appearance:** Shrink the dash (remove edge-to-edge).
- [ ] **App Grid Defaults**
    - [ ] **Behavior:** Sort alphabetically (no folders).
    - [ ] **Behavior:** Pinning to dock must not remove from grid.

## 📦 Default Software
- [x] **Winboat:** Determine installation (DNF/Flatpak) and add to system defaults.
- [ ] **Dropbox:** Install official Dropbox client (System/DNF/RPM).
- [x] **Implement** System-level GNOME Boxes + Virt-Manager
- [ ] **Implement** Starship terminal prompt by default with light-theme terminal (steal from Bluefin)
    - [ ] **Implement** ujust "configure" recipes for starship bluefin (system default, "reset"), starship bazzite (deviation), starship off (deviation)

## 🌳 The `ujust` Architecture Tree
*The master plan for `files/system/usr/share/ublue-os/just/99-redfox.just`.*

> **Architecture Note: Deviations vs. Resets**
> *   **Deviation Recipes** (e.g., `set-window-controls-right`) use `gsettings set` to apply specific user preferences.
> *   **Reset/Default Recipes** (e.g., `set-window-controls-left-gnome`) use `gsettings reset` to clear user overrides and revert to the system-wide baseline defined in `gschema-overrides`.

## Fixups/New (Items that arrive after a fix is already implemented)
- [ ] Screenshot (add Windows super + shift + s shortcut for selection screenshot; move fullscreen screenshot to printscreen)
- [x] Check that Boxes is installing as system package and is cross-compatible with VMM
- [x] Confirm that Winboat is best as app-image (RPM is published on github releases page, so we could be doing this as a system package; the issue is that the appimage setup is not frictionless).
